Every VHDL design description consists of at least one entity / architecture pair, 
or one entity with multiple architectures. 

The entity section of the HDL design is used to declare the I/O ports of the circuit, 
while the description code resides within architecture portion. 

Standardized design libraries are typically used and are included prior to the entity declaration. 

This is accomplished by including the code "library ieee;" and "use ieee.std_logic_1164.all;".
