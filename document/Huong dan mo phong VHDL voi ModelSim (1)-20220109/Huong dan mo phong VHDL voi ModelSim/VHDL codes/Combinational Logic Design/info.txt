Combinational Logic Design 
(ESD Chapter 2: Figure 2.4)

We use port map statement to achieve the structural model (components instantiations). 

The following example shows how to write the program to incorporate multiple components 
in the design of a more complex circuit. 

In order to simulate the design, a simple test bench code must be written to apply a 
sequence of inputs (Stimulators) to the circuit being tested (UUT). 

The output of the test bench and UUT interaction can be observed in the simulation waveform window.
