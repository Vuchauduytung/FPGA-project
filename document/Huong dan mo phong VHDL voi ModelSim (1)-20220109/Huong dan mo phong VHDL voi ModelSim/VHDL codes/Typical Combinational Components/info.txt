Typical Combinational Components 
(ESD Chapter 2: Figure 2.5)

The following behavior style codes demonstrate the concurrent and sequential capabilities of VHDL. 
The concurrent statements are written within the body of an architecture. 

They include concurrent signal assignment, concurrent process and component instantiations (port map statement). 

Sequential statements are written within a process statement, function or procedure. 
Sequential statement include case statement, if-then-else statement and loop statement.
