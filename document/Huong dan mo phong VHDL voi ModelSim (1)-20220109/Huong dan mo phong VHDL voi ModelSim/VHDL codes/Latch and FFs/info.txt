Latch & Flip-Flops 
(ESD Chapter 2.3)

Besides from the circuit input and output signals, there are normally two other important signals, 
reset and clock, in the sequential circuit. 

The reset signal is either active-high or active-low status and the circuit status transition can occur 
at either clock rising-edge or falling-edge. 

Flip-Flop is a basic component of the sequential circuits.
